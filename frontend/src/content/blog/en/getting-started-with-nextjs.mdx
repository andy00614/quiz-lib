# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js is a React-based full-stack framework that provides many out-of-the-box features, enabling developers to quickly build high-performance web applications.

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework developed by Vercel that provides the following core features:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**: Improves first-page load speed and SEO
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)**: Pre-builds pages for optimal performance
- **API Routes**: Build API endpoints within the same project
- **File System Routing**: Automatically generates routes based on file structure
- **Built-in Optimizations**: Image optimization, font optimization, etc.

## Quick Start

### Creating a New Project

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

### Project Structure

```
my-app/
├── app/
│   ├── layout.tsx
│   ├── page.tsx
│   └── globals.css
├── public/
├── next.config.js
└── package.json
```

## App Router vs Pages Router

Next.js 13 introduced the new App Router, which is based on React Server Components and provides better performance and developer experience.

### Advantages of App Router

1. **Better Performance**: Uses server components by default
2. **Nested Layouts**: Supports complex layout structures
3. **Streaming Rendering**: Progressive page loading
4. **Parallel Routes**: Render multiple page segments simultaneously

## Data Fetching

### Fetching Data in Server Components

```tsx
async function BlogPost({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  const post = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/posts/${params.id}`)
    .then(res => res.json());

  return (
    <article>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </article>
  );
}
```

### Fetching Data in Client Components

```tsx
'use client';

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function UserProfile() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch('/api/user')
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(setUser);
  }, []);

  if (!user) return <div>Loading...</div>;

  return <div>Hello, {user.name}!</div>;
}
```

## Styling Solutions

Next.js supports multiple styling solutions:

- **CSS Modules**: Scoped CSS isolation
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Styled Components**: CSS-in-JS solution
- **Sass/SCSS**: CSS preprocessor

## Deployment

Next.js applications can be deployed to multiple platforms:

- **Vercel**: Zero-configuration deployment
- **Netlify**: Static site hosting
- **AWS**: Using Amplify or EC2
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment

## Summary

Next.js is a powerful React framework that simplifies the development process of modern web applications. By providing server-side rendering, static generation, API routes, and other features, Next.js allows developers to focus on implementing business logic.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, Next.js is an excellent choice for building React applications.
